Then map the areas in Italy to show which geographic centers show greatest impact on economic development for intellectual property in high technology sector. Compare Italy's growth in intellectual property receipts vs. the rest of the European Union in the period of 1990-2015. </p>"

    "* <b>WK12:</b> Use GeoNode, or plot.ly, to create geographic clusters showing where highest amount of capital investments occurred. Refine layout of web pages.
