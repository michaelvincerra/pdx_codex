<!-- ## # Practice: Validator

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/`, in a branch, and make a GitHub pull request all named `validator`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html`, your CSS file named `site.css`, and your JS file named `site.js` in that directory.

Create a sign-up form for a user to fill out and submit via a button.

It should ask for the following fields:

* Full Name in `First Last` format
* Date of birth in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
* Phone Number in `555-555-5555` format

A field is only valid if it is empty or matches the described format:

*   The full name should be two words separated by a space.
    Capitalization doesn't matter.

*   The date of birth should be three numbers separated by `-`.
    The first number should be 4 digits, the second and third 2 digits.
    Don't worry about checking the day or month range.

*   The phone number should be three numbers separated by `-`.
    The first and second should be 3 digits, the third 4 digits.

_As the user is typing_, validate each field.
If the content is currently invalid, the input box should be yellow.
